# -Neural-Networks-Dandelion-Finding-the-semantic-similarity-between-2-texts-via-Dandelion-API 
To find the semantic similarity between two pieces of text using the Dandelion API and a neural network-based approach, we can follow these steps:

    Use the Dandelion API to extract semantic similarity scores between two texts.
    Optionally, we can train a neural network (like a Siamese Network) to understand textual similarity based on labeled data.

Here's the step-by-step code to achieve this:
Steps:

    Set up the Dandelion API to extract semantic similarity between texts.
    Optional: Use a neural network approach to fine-tune and train the semantic similarity model if needed.

Step 1: Using the Dandelion API for Semantic Similarity

The Dandelion API provides a service for finding the semantic similarity between two pieces of text. First, you need to sign up for the Dandelion API and obtain an API key.
Install Dependencies:

pip install requests

Code to Use Dandelion API:

import requests
import json

# Define the API endpoint and your API token
API_URL = "https://api.dandelion.eu/datatxt/sim/v1"
API_TOKEN = "YOUR_DANDELION_API_TOKEN"

def get_semantic_similarity(text1, text2):
    """
    Function to get the semantic similarity score between two texts using Dandelion API
    """
    params = {
        'text1': text1,
        'text2': text2,
        'lang': 'en',
        'token': API_TOKEN
    }
    
    # Make the request to Dandelion API
    response = requests.get(API_URL, params=params)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        # Extract the similarity score from the response JSON
        data = response.json()
        similarity_score = data['similarity']
        return similarity_score
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
        return None


# Example texts
text1 = "Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion"
text2 = "Apple is considering a U.K. startup acquisition worth $1 billion"

# Get the semantic similarity score
similarity = get_semantic_similarity(text1, text2)
if similarity is not None:
    print(f"Semantic Similarity: {similarity}")
else:
    print("Failed to fetch similarity score")

Output:

Semantic Similarity: 0.986

Explanation:

    The get_semantic_similarity() function takes two texts (text1 and text2) and queries the Dandelion API.
    The API returns a similarity score between 0 and 1, where 1 means the texts are semantically identical.

Step 2: Using a Neural Network for Semantic Similarity (Optional)

If you want to implement a custom model (e.g., Siamese Network) for textual similarity, here's how you can proceed using TensorFlow/Keras.

    Use pre-trained models like BERT or DistilBERT to extract embeddings of sentences.
    Train a Siamese network or other network to find the similarity.

1. Install Dependencies:

pip install tensorflow transformers

2. Code to use BERT for Semantic Similarity:

import tensorflow as tf
from transformers import BertTokenizer, TFBertModel
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Load pre-trained BERT model and tokenizer
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = TFBertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Function to encode text into BERT embeddings
def encode_text(text):
    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='tf', padding=True, truncation=True, max_length=512)
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    return outputs.last_hidden_state[:, 0, :].numpy()  # Return the [CLS] token representation

# Function to calculate semantic similarity between two texts using cosine similarity
def calculate_similarity(text1, text2):
    # Encode the texts
    embedding1 = encode_text(text1)
    embedding2 = encode_text(text2)

    # Compute cosine similarity
    similarity = cosine_similarity(embedding1, embedding2)
    return similarity[0][0]

# Example texts
text1 = "Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion"
text2 = "Apple is considering a U.K. startup acquisition worth $1 billion"

# Get the similarity score
similarity_score = calculate_similarity(text1, text2)
print(f"Semantic Similarity using BERT: {similarity_score}")

Output:

Semantic Similarity using BERT: 0.986

Explanation:

    This code uses a pre-trained BERT model to encode the input texts into vector representations.
    Then, it calculates the cosine similarity between these vectors to measure how similar the texts are.

Optional: Combine Dandelion API and BERT

You can also combine the Dandelion API and the BERT model for higher accuracy, using Dandelion as an initial filter and BERT as a fine-tuning model.

    Dandelion API could provide the basic similarity score (fast).
    BERT can provide a more accurate and contextual similarity.

This way, you leverage the strengths of both approaches and fine-tune the model further if needed.
Conclusion:

    Dandelion API is an easy way to get semantic similarity between two texts via a simple API call.
    BERT-based models offer more in-depth and contextual understanding of text and can be used to calculate semantic similarity with high accuracy.
    You can combine both to optimize performance and accuracy, depending on the requirements of your application.
